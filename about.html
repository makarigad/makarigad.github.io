  <h3>About the Project</h3>
  <p>The Makari Gad Hydro Power Project (MGHEP) is a ‘Run of the River (ROR) type project developed in the Apihimal Rural Municipality of Darchula district of Sudurpashchim province of Nepal with the installed capacity of 10 MW and contract energy of 69.756 GWh with NEA. 
  <p>Geographically the survey area of the project lies within the latitude between 29o48’03”N and 29o46’54” N and longitude between 80o52’47”E and 80o50’33”E. The location map and vicinity map of the project area are shown in Figure 1-1 and Figure 1-2 respectively.</p>
  <p>The Makari Gad is a small left sided tributary of the Chameliya River. It is the perennial stream that originates from the Chaupode Dhar and Dharmaghar Dhar and meets the Chameliya River at the Makarigad Gaun village. The total catchment of the Makari Gad at the proposed headwork site is 37.8 sq km.</p>
  <p>The Project consists of a Diversion Weir across Makari river, an Intake Structure, Approach Canal, a Desanding Basin cum Head Pond, 3.2 km long Surface Penstock located along the right bank of Makari river and a Powerhouse with its tailrace outfall found in the Chameliya river, upstream of the confluence of Makari river and Chameliya river.</p>
  <p>The Project’s installed capacity is 10 MW with a design discharge of 1.35 m3/s and a net head of 862.35 m. The generated electricity from the Powerhouse is fed to the substation (33/132 kV) at Balanch through a 27.2 km long 33 kV Single Circuit Transmission line.</p>
  <p>The project is accessible upto powerhouse by road. The 254 km Dhangadi- Gokuleshwor section of Mahakali Highway and 25 km Gokuleshwor-Bitule is all weather black-topped roads where as 25 km Bitule-Makarigad section road is seasonable earthen road. 2 km long Ropeway is used to transport material from powerhouse to dam.</p>
